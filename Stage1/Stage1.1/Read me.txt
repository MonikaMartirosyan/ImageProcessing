In folder "Stage1.1" there are the image files that exhibit Standard Behaivor. Here I tried to apply Binary Layers and different filters to successfully produce smoothened and prominent regions and minimize or remove insignificant details.
For the Binary_Layer_2 and Binary_Layer_3 the best outcomes were for 72-11.jpg (uploaded as well), however on average 74-11.jpg was a better example for Standard Behavior exhibition.


74-11-layer0-Median(radius 4)-Maximum(radius 1).tif
74-11-layer1-Maximum(radius 1)-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 7).tif
74-11-layer2-Minimum(radius 2)-Median(radius 5).tif
74-11-layer3-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 5).tif


In subfolder "Fails" I have the image files which in my oppinion fail to be considered as ones to exhibit Standard Behavior.
