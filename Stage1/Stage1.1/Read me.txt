In this folder there are some results of many trials of applying different filters (Mean, Median, Gaussian Blur, etc.) as well as extracting the
Binary Layers as to produce smoothened and prominent regions and minimize or remove insignificant details. 
As you can see the folder contains subfolders (i.e. "Average Result", "Fails"), the discription of which will be mentioned below.

The main results which appeard to be the best fit for Standard Behavior exhibition are the following: 
74-11-Mean(radius 3)-layer0-Maximum(radius 1)
74-11-Median(radius 3)-layer2-Minimum(radius 1)
74-11-layer1-Maximum(radius 1)-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 7)
74-11-layer3-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 5)
After trying all, I thought that the best example for the Standard Behavior exhibition (from my individual list of image files) was 74-11.jpg. For each layer there should have been an individual approach, the steps of which you can see above.

In the subfolder called "Average Result" I submitted the results which were pretty close (as to me) to be considered as exhibitions of Standard Behavior. After many trails I decided to take two of the files from the "Average Result" subfolder as my final result.
72-11-layer2-Median(radius 3)-Minimum(radius 1)
72-11-layer3-Minimum(radius 0.5)-Median(radius 3)
74-11-layer0-Median(radius 4)-Maximum(radius 1)
74-11-layer1-Maximum(radius 1)-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 7)
74-11-layer2-Minimum(radius 2)-Median(radius 5)
74-11-layer3-Minimum(radius 1)-Median(radius 5)

In "Fails" there are some of the results that cannot be considered as exhibitions of Standard Behavior:
71-11-layer3-fail
72-11-layer1-Maximum(radius 2)-Median(radius 2)
72-11-layer1-fail
72-11-layer3-fail
73-11-layer0-Mean(radius 2)-Minimum(radius 2)
73-11-layer0-fail
74-10-layer0-Maximum(radius 2)
74-14-layer0
74-14-layer2
