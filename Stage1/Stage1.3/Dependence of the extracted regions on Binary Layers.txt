In this substage as well as in previous one I think there are more than one approaches that we can use to observe the head rotations and the emotions. The first approach appears to be a very simple one, just applying the Binary Layer 2 to observe the different outcomes regarding what direction the head of the person is facing. What refers to the emotions I took the last image file (74-12.jpg) which appears to be the best representation of Standard Behavior and that is the one we actually want to observe. Another approach we can use to observe the difference between the moments and eccentricity is calculate them as well as Central Moments, Normalized Central Moments and Orientation.
